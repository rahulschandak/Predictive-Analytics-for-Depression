# Predictive Analytics for Depression

Depression is a widespread problem that affects millions of people all around the world. Detecting and diagnosing it early can be crucial in avoiding the negative impact it can have on people's lives. Many people who are in depression often fail to realize/ accept that they are depressed. This prevents them from taking proper measures and treatments to cope with depression. That's why we're working on a project that aims to predict depression using different algorithms that consider factors like behavioral and psychosocial factors.

Methods: 
  - Data Tidying
  - Data Visualization
  - Outlier Detection
  - Exploratory Data Analysis
  - Feature Selection
  - Training 5 Supervised Machine Learning prediction models
